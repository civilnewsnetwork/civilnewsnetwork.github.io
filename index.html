  <h1>Tallahassee Bus Boycott</h1>
  <p>
    “Get out of the bus or I am calling the police!” bellowed a furious white bus driver after two black college students refused to leave a segregated bus in Tallahassee. The two female Florida A&M students, Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson, initially refused to move out of the “white section” of the bus citing their exhaustion. Resultantly, the bus driver immediately called the police on both Jakes and Patterson. Both of the students were arrested and charged with “potentially inciting a riot.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the apprehension, the Ku Klux Klan reportedly burned a cross in front of Wilhemina Jake’s city home. In response, FAMU students protected her, escorting to and from where she needed to be. But to the President of the Student Body Association, Brodus Hartley, that was not enough. He called a congregation, announcing that in protest of the treatment of their two fellow FAMU students, FAMU students would walk rather than ride the bus.
</p>
  <p>
    At the end of the meeting, eyewitnesses reported that as the public bus was coming through the campus, FAMU football players, passionately motivated by the rally, “literally lifted that bus up and shook the people off of it.” The bus driver frantically maneuvered to get the bus off of the campus following the heated encounter. The bus boycott was on.
    </p>
  <p>
    The FAMU student body quickly orchestrated a successful bus boycott which gained national attention. Martin Luther King Jr. also traveled to Tallahassee, encouraging the boycotters and inspiring them to collectively join and show their support for the nationwide Civil Rights movement demanding equality.
    </p>
  <p>
    After the bus boycott was established by FAMU students, the larger Tallahassee community was quick to join in on the protests. Reverend C.K. Steele, a pastor for the Bethel Baptist Church, spearheaded the creation of the Inter-Civic Council (ICC) to primarily handle the logistics of the bus boycott. Additionally, the ICC also took on the responsibility of fighting the negativity which the media was targeting towards the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 
    </p>
  <p>
    During the bus boycott, the ICC provided transportation for African Americans by coordinating a carpool. However, the ICC was charged with “operating an illegal for-hire operation without a franchise” by city officials; consequently, Reverend Steele was arrested. The ICC fought back with the slogan, “I would rather walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.” Although the ICC remains focus on the movement, they still face a great deal of adversity in the form of state policeman and segregationists burning crosses and vandalizing Reverend Steel’s home. Due to the terrorism, the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee (FLIC), got involved, investigating organizations that may have communist ideals.
    </p>
  <p>
    On July 1st, Tallahassee bus fare revenue experienced a noticeable decline, forcing Tallahassee’s Cities Transit to suspend all routes. On August 2nd, Cities Transit announced that the company will resume regular service and hire African Americans as drivers on the FAMU student bus routes. The boycott was a success.
